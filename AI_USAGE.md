Prompt 1: Take on the role of a student developing a basic project to compare college football quarterback stats and their performance in the NFL from 2001-2023 that can be brought up through an input function of the players name. Help me design a python file named main.py that extracts and cleans the data using pandas from the provided API and attached csv. file written efficiently. Include very basic error handling and rate limiting if applicable. I have the API key for the college football API API: https://apinext.collegefootballdata.com

Prompt 2: I recieved this message upon running the code: Warning: One or both datasets are empty
ETL process complete! Dataset contains 0 players

Prompt 3: This is the output after running the new code: 
pasted long bug-fix edited output

Prompt 4: Changes made to the sample time frame for the code are now working properly, apply changes to the remainder of the code

Prompt 5: Here is an example output, edit the code so that the games stat for college is either not 0 or not included. Also Add in logic for NFL players to compute the Completion %, Yards per Attempt and TD/INT ratio:
============================================================
PLAYER PROFILE: Will Levis
============================================================
COLLEGE CAREER:
  Team: Kentucky
  Conference: SEC
  Years: 2020-2022
  Games: 0
  Pass Attempts: 663
  Completions: 434
  Completion %: 63.9%
  Pass Yards: 5,420
  Touchdowns: 43
  Interceptions: 22
  TD/INT Ratio: 1.61
NFL CAREER:
  Games: 18
  Pass Completions: 298.0
  Pass Attempts: 510
  Pass Yards: 3,616
  Pass Tds: 16
  Interceptions: 8.0
  Qb Rating: 84.2

  Prompt 6: Now that this part is functioning, edit the main.py function so that it takes the raw data and enriches it using the deepseek api, which I have a private key for. Use deepseek AI to analyze each player and determine what leads to a skilled NFL QB using the stats provided. Then export the raw data to data/raw/ and the enriched data to data/enriched/. Additionally create a new file called deepseek_enrichment.py for the AI logic

AI vs Human Code:

This project was written using vibe coding. The initial set up prompt created the base for the main.py function, and upon running I noticed that there was no college players being tracked, after checking the output and the API, I realized that the incorrect inputs were being used to parse the API so I had Claude redo the code and add in bug fixing print statements, which helped identify exactly what inputs were wrong and rebuild them, resulting in the code fixing. After this first debug, I checked the data outputs and saw that some statistics were not represented in both college and NFL statistics, and yards per attempt was not in the data at all. I used another prompt to compute these statistics and add them to the output. After bug fixing the extraction and transformation process, I was able to begin vibe coding the deepseek enrichment, which was successfully implemented on the first attempt and the raw and enriched data were correctly stored to their corresponding folders.

Bug Fixing:

The two bugs mentioned above are the incorrect inputs for the college football statistics API and the statistics not containing the correct mentrics for analysis. Both of these bugs were caught in the output received from running the initial extraction and transformation. This was easily fixed by Claude create bug fixing print statements and identifying where the issues were and how to fix them. The bug fixing was luckily handled entirely through reading the outputs and using that to create prompts for vibe coding.
